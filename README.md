# Image Repository by Jackie Trang
Built an image repository that allows uploading images and deleting images using Flask framework and SQLite database.

## 🤔 Assumptions
- Small application with ~1000 users per month
- Traffic is not evenly distributed

## ✔️ Use cases
1. Sign up new user
2. Log in existing user
3. Upload images, duplications are allowed
4. Delete images

        |----- test_features.py (test with pytest)
```
## 💃 Project Demo
Here's a walkthrough of the app:
1. Sign up new user and log in existing user
<img src='demo1.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough' />

2. Upload and delete images in that user's repository
<img src='demo2.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough' />

## 🧪 Tests
<strong>Note: </strong> Make sure the app is running when test files are executed. This can be done by having split terminals in IDE.
Go to `/tests` directory:
```sh
python unittests.py # test with unittest
python -m pytest test_features.py -v # test with pytest
```

## ☁️ Deployment:
The application is running at: https://image-repo-app.herokuapp.com/
        
## 🏃‍♀️ How to run the app
### Windows 
1. Clone this repository to local computer
2. Set up virtual environment and install dependencies 
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up database (main directory)
```sh
python db_setup.py
```
4. Run the application
```sh
python app.py
```
The app will be running on ``` http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ``` in your web browser.

### MacOS
Step 1, 3, 4 are similar to Windows.
The only difference is in activating virtual environment (step 2):
```sh
python3.6 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
